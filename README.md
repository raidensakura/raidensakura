Hi, I'm Raiden.

Just a regular developer with experience in DevOps and SysAdmin.  

GitHub took down my Hoyolab auto login repo.  
I moved it to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/raidensakura/hoyolab-auto-login).

I run a homelab where I selfhost, test and learn things.

I also host a Discord bot called Shogun, she's only able to be inside 100 servers at a time.  
Feel free to contact me on Discord if you need any of her functionality. You can check her stats down here.

Here's my ko-fi link if you prefer it over my GitHub Sponsor link.

My girlfriend loves [Elysia](https://honkaiimpact3.fandom.com/wiki/Elysia) so here's a picture of her.
